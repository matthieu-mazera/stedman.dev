Hello again, I'm Steve Stedman and I live in beautiful Austin, Texas.

I am a web developer with 20+ years of experience leading cross-functional teams and driving all phases of the software development life cycle. I take pride in crafting well-designed, innovative, and accessible sites.

I am an avid learner, deeply involved with the local tech community, and eager to inspire that enthusiasm in others.
