# {{ title }}

I'm Steve Stedman, a technology leader with 18+ years experience empowering diverse cross-functional teams and driving all phases of the software development life cycle. I take pride in crafting elegant, empowering, and engaging customer-focused web experiences.

I am an avid learner, deeply involved with the Austin tech community, and eager to inspire that enthusiasm in others.

### Colophon

Here's the spec sheet for my current tech stack:

* Static site generator: [Eleventy (11ty)](https://11ty.dev/)
* Templating language: [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/)
* Syntax highlighting: [Prism](https://prismjs.com/), [Atom Dark theme](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-atom-dark.css)
* Icons: [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)
* CSS framework: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
* CSS preprocessor: [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/)
* CSS cleanup: [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/)
* JavaScript linting: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Airbnb config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
* Source code repository and hosting: [GitHub](https://github.com/stedman/stedman.dev/)
* Deployment (CI/CD): [GitHub](https://github.com/stedman/stedman.dev/actions)

I also explored [html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) but felt the additional dependency and build step wasn't worth the ~2K savings per page at this time.
